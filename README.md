# Habitat associations and abundance estimates for two least-disturbed Redside Dace (*Clinostomus elongatus*) populations in tributaries of Lake Huron (Ontario, Canada)
## Karl A. Lamothe, D. Andrew R. Drake

#### Population abundance estimates are lacking for many imperilled fishes, which imposes uncertainty on the assessment, listing, and recovery processes. This limitation exists for Redside Dace (*Clinostomus elongatus*), an Endangered species in Canada that has experienced several extirpations due to widespread urbanization within its range. We developed generalized linear models to determine habitat associations and generate indices of abundance for two Redside Dace populations at the periphery of the species range in an area unaffected by urbanization (Gully Creek and Unknown Stanley J [USJ] Tributary, Lake Huron, Ontario). Models of Redside Dace abundance indicated positive associations with the number of co-occurring, nest-building fishes and the proportion of pool habitat with undercut banks. Extrapolation of site-level abundance estimates and habitat availability suggested more Redside Dace adults in USJ Tributary (95% credible interval: 1,418-67,318) than Gully Creek (208-11,868); however, low sample size led to high uncertainty in abundance estimates. Ultimately, these results will inform future habitat protection efforts and provide potential recovery targets for the restoration of other populations within and beyond ecosystems affected by urbanization.
